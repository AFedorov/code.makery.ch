  <h4>Getting started with HTML &amp; CSS</h4>
  <p>You will need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS to create Web Applications. The <em>HTML &amp; CSS Tutorial</em> provides a good introduction if you're new to the web.</p>

  {{ with .Site.GetPage "/library/html-css" }}
    {{ partial "paths/item.html" . }}
  {{ end }}

  <p><strong>Optional:</strong> <em>More HTML &amp; CSS</em> is a collection of topics around HTML and CSS. They are helpful but not necessary to continue with Dart programming below.</p>

  {{ with .Site.GetPage "/library/more-html-css" }}
    {{ partial "paths/item.html" . }}
  {{ end }}


  <h4>Getting started with Dart Programming</h4>
  <p>If you're new to programming I recommend you start with the <em>Hello Dart</em> course. If you're already fluent in another programming language you could just skim through.</p>

  {{ with .Site.GetPage "/library/hello-dart" }}
    {{ partial "paths/item.html" . }}
  {{ end }}


  <h4>Dart Web App</h4>
  <p>The <em>Dart Kanban</em> tutorial connects the two worlds of HTML/CSS and Dart. It is well suited for learning how to create an interactive Dart web application from scratch.</p>

  {{ with .Site.GetPage "/library/dart-kanban" }}
    {{ partial "paths/item.html" . }}
