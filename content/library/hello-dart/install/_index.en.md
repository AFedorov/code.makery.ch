To start programming we need...

* the **Dart Editor** and
* the `Hello Dart` scenarios.

1. Download the [Dart Editor here](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download.html).
2. Unzip the downloaded files to your hard drive.

## Opening the `Hello Dart` Scenarios

1. Download the the `hello_dart_scenarios.zip` file from [Hello Dart Releases](https://github.com/marcojakob/hello-dart/releases) (use the latest version).  
2. Unzip the files to your computer.
3. In Dart Editor: Click on **File | Open Existing Folder...**. Choose the `hello_dart_scenarios` folder that you have just unzipped.
4. Use a double-click to open the file `my_player.dart` from the subfolder `web/part1/scenario1.01`.   
<p>
