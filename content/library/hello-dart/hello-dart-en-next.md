Congratulations, you've reached the end of this series! Here are some options of how you could continue with your programming adventure.


### Dart Kanban - A better Todo List

*currently in German only*

Learn to create an interactive web application. We will program an interactive Kanban board.

### More coming soon...

I plan to translate the *Dart Kanban* tutorial to English and publish more programming tutorials soon. If you want to get informed when they are released, register for the [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/codemakery).


### Feedback

I would love to hear from you. Write a comment if you've successfully completed the tutorial and also if you have any suggestions about how the tutorial could be improved. <a href="#disqus_thread"><i class="fa fa-comment-o"></i></a>
