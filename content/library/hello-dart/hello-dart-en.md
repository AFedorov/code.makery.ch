> `Hello Dart` is a playful introduction to programming with Dart.

Previously, it was hardly realistic to program mobile or web-based applications. The Dart programming language provides a solution how such applications can be programmed much easier.

`Hello Dart` guides you through the basics of programming. No prior programming knowledge is required. The playful world of `Hello Dart` visualizes the execution of your programs. Soon you will want to break out of the limiting rules of the `Hello Dart` world, which is intended. After the introduction with `Hello Dart` you will have a good foundation to start realizing your own web projects.

## The World

The world of `Hello Dart` consists of fields, trees and stars.

## The Player

In the world of `Hello Dart` we move around with our character. You can choose from one of four characters.

![Characters](/assets/library/hello-dart/intro/characters.png)

A game character, called `Player` has the following actions and sensors that he/she can use:


### Actions

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>

      <td style="vertical-align:middle">![Move](/assets/library/hello-dart/intro/move.png)</td>
      <td style="vertical-align:middle">`move()`</td>
      <td style="vertical-align:middle">The player makes a step forward.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align:middle">![Turn Left](/assets/library/hello-dart/intro/turn-left.png)</td>
      <td style="vertical-align:middle">`turnLeft()`</td>
      <td style="vertical-align:middle">The player turns left by 90 degrees.</td>
